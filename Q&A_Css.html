Each module deals with a specific aspect of styling (like backgrounds, borders, animations, flexbox, etc.). This made development faster and allowed browsers to adopt features incrementally. <br>
            CSS3 Features: <br>
            *Selectors <br>
            *Box Model <br>
            *Backgrounds and Borders <br>
            *Transitions and Animations <br>
            *Flexbox and Grid Layout <br>
